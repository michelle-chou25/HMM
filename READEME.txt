# This is an implementation of Parts Of Speech tagging by using  hidden markov model 
with viterbi algorithm and Witten-Bell smoothing.

## To run the program to predict the POS tagging word by word
export the file hmm_predict_word.py to a desired directory, and within a command line, navigate to that directory. 
Then the file can be executed by: py hmm_predict_word.py

## To run the program to predict the POS tagging sentence by sentence
export the file HMM_predict_sentences.py to a desired directory, and within a command line, navigate to that directory. 
Then the file can be executed by: py HMM_predict_sentences.py

## To run to program to find the similarity between different languages.
export the file "comparing_lang_similarity.py"to a desired directory, and within a command line, navigate to that directory. 
Then the file can be executed by: py comparing_lang_similarity.py

###to make sure the program will run smoothly, keep directory "corpora" in the same level with the python files mentioned above
